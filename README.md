# Project

This assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/knights-travails) is the first part of working towards making a working chess game, the final Ruby project.

In this part, a data structure similar to a binary tree is constructed to keep track of the knight piece's moves. In chess, the knight can reach any square on the board with enough turns by moving in a two steps forward and one step to the side pattern. 

This assingment calculates all the available moves for the knight piece and outputs the shortest path between the starting position and desired position.
